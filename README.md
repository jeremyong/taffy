# Tuppy üç≤

## NOTE: CURRENTLY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

Tuppy is a no-fuss, batteries included static-site blog engine. It is designed
to deploy easily on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is built on
top of Markdown and LaTeX. Tuppy is geared toward bloggers with a math, science,
and tech bent, but all usage is encouraged.

Here are some of the batteries Tuppy includes:

1. LaTeX support for inline math (single $ signs) and display math (surrounded
   with $$).
2. Full syntax highlighting
3. Customizable theme based on [Material Design](https://material.io/)
4. WebGL integration to seamlessly produced demos in-browser with custom JS
5. Smoothly resizing responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Usage

Tuppy is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and distributed
via NPM. To start a new blog, execute the following commands:

```bash
# In your blog folder
npm init
npm install toffee
```
